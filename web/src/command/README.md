# web/src/command: the command view (lane E)

Lane E's folder. Lane E has no owner yet, so lane A built **E-07, the approval inbox** (issue #70).
**Build on it; don't start it again.**

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `ApprovalInbox.tsx` | LANE_E §7.2: pending proposals newest first, decided ones collapsed below with "Approved by Dana at 18:58"; kind, summary, reason (expands), evidence thumbnails, briefing; **Approve** (`A`), **Reject** (`X`, needs a one-line reason), **Edit** (the team of an assignment, the briefing text: sent as `edits`, part of what is approved); keys act on the focused card only; "You are ___" kept in `sessionStorage` |
| `ApprovalInbox.test.tsx` | test 4 (and no "clear") |

Mounted in the live mission page (`web/src/ingest/LiveMission.tsx`, tab **Approvals**, `#m/<id>/approvals`) with
`useMission().decide`. An approved briefing reaches the radio's outbound queue on the server; nothing is
transmitted from the inbox. Checked in Chromium against the real server (val photos, cv2.dnn, Nemotron):
screenshot in `docs/architecture/screens/approval-inbox.png`.

Still lane E's: the front door, the rest of the command view (task board, roster, clue log, event feed with
filters, assignment card), `__fixtures__` for demo mode.
